# AudioProcessHelper
Handles the Priority and Processor Affinity of your selected Audio Programs 

If your friends on Discord/Teamspeak or whatever tell you that your sound is cracking and it's very hard to understand you, you probably have the same issue as me. 💞

*You're using Audio Programs such as VoiceMeeter, too?*
*Your friends are telling you that your audio is cracking?*

Then this program will help you out!

###### The fix is based on all actions that the someone did in a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/71HrZfR_Fro).


# How to install?
* Just click on the _Releases_ on your right and **download** the first package.
* **Extract** it to any location you want and ... 
* ... then you just need to **execute** the .exe file and you're good to go! 😀

# How to use?
Well the program is built in a really intuitive way but I'll work that through here.

*On the left* there is the section where you can *add or remove the processes* that you want to include.

*On the right* ... wow... what was it... I guess you start the code 🤔😍

# Some other stuff
### You're having any sort of problems with the application?

Thanks to GitHub you can easily write Issues at the a special section for that. Just click on `Issues` at the top of the page! (Thank you Github ❤) 

### When you execute the program it says that you're missing the .net runtime?
Then you can easily download it [here](https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/8bc41df1-cbb4-4da6-944f-6652378e9196/1014aacedc80bbcc030dabb168d2532f/windowsdesktop-runtime-5.0.9-win-x64.exe) at the official page.

An no! This is not just some garbage on you computer! 😄 This is a widly used dependency in many programs! 😘

You can also try to download the non-minified version in the Releases because there are many packages that you may not have installed. 

### Why does this program require admin privileges?
The process audiodg.exe that is causing your problem is a system process so we need your admin rights to increase the priority of such an important process! Weird huh? 😄

### You're not sure if this is unsafe? 
GitHub is a platform for OpenSource code and this .exe and .dll file are just the result from my code. I just wanted to make this as easy as possible for you. 🥰 If I would only publish my code you would need to build this project to an executable file and I think you don't want to do that. 😏

### You want to put the Program into your Auto Start?
I wrote a little Guide in the Issue #1. You can watch it [there](https://github.com/M1chelle99/AudioProcessHelper/issues/1).

### You're a developer and you don't like my code?
Well if that's so ... Write me you're feedback in the Issues ❤ I wont be mad! I love improving! 💖

### Recommended Programs to include
By just adding audiodg you have the main bottleneck fixed, **but** there are still a few processes that could work *clearer*.

When I use the code for my personal usage I always include:
* audiodg.exe
* Discord.exe
* ts3client_win64.exe
* voicemeeter8.exe

So choose wisely 😘

# Thank you for using my code ❤
